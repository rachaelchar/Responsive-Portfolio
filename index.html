                <p>I'm currently enrolled in UNH's Coding Bootcamp, which is a full-stack web development program in
                    Portsmouth, NH. I graduated from Allegheny College in 2017 with a BA in Women's, Gender, and
                    Sexuality Studies and a minor in Classical Studies, then went on to work in marketing and events for
                    a nonprofit animal shelter. </p>
                <p>When I decided to make a change in my career, I chose to pursue coding because it encompasses the
                    dichotomies of my ideal work environment: creativity and logic, and collaboration and self-reliance.
                    The marriage of constant problem solving and being able to create and improve experiences and tools
                    makes coding an engrossing subject for me. </p>
