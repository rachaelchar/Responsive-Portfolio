# Responsive-Portfolio

## 02_Week Assignment

To create this project, I started by copying the code from my original Basic-Portfolio, which was the first UNH Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. The goal of this project was to make my original portfolio more responsive to smaller screen sizes. In order to do this, I added media queries and did not utilize Bootstrap at all.
